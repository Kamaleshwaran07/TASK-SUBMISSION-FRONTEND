Elevate your academic excellence with our new task submission platform with personalized feedback

Inorder to access the app you have to sign up in *[Task Submission](https://tasksubmission.netlify.app/)*

After registering your account, you can submit your deployed task urls and code in the form and wait for some time to recieve the feedback by logging into your account.

You can also keep track of your progress from day1 as the submitted tasks will be displayed on your dashboard.



## Features

Each and every time you submit your task, the list gets updated

This is done by calling the ***gettask api*** whenever you submit the task and passing it to the dashboard component.


## UI

### BootStrap

I have used bootstrap css for the UI of the app but I didn't make it responsive. By the time you reading this I would have updated the responsiveness

### Update

I am working on the refresh button so that if there is any changes in component you dont have to log out and log back in
